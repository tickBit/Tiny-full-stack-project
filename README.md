# Tiny full stack project

Tiny full stack experiment. User can play a tune by clicking the play icon at the frontend. The music starts playing from the backend. User can upload more music to the backend. Comments button can be used to toggle comments section for each tune. Each tune has its own comments..

I should develop this one too a bit further, take care all the special cases..

## Instructions

- start the backend server in the backend drawer: python app.py
- just open the index.html from frontend drawer into a browser

## Python libraries needed

- flask
- flask-cors
- flask_socketio
- python-vlc
- watchdog

## The music

The music "Terminator memories" is written by me. It's only about 900 kb.
